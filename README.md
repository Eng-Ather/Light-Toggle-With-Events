# ON-OFF-Lamp
A JavaScript-based project demonstrating dynamic state management with event listeners. This app toggles light images between "ON" and "OFF" states, using addEventListener to handle user clicks. Buttons are disabled based on the current state to prevent conflicting actions. This project highlights DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and basic UI interaction, providing a practical example of responsive front-end development.
